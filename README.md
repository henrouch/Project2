This program will allow users to store a list of URLs and give them the option to shorten the URLs they store with a less than 12-character ASCII code. For example: 

https://www.google.com/home?userId=12345&profile=abcdef  

Can be stored as  

https://www.google.com/short123  

And “short123” is the code that is used to classify this URL in storage.  

This code can be provided by the user or randomly generated.
